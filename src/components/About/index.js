          I am an aspiring web developer, who through deliberate practice and dedication am working towards becoming a full fledged web developer.
          I am a recent recipient of a Full Stack Web Development certificate from a coding boot camp hosted by Michigan State University.
          My plan for success is to use the foundational web development skills as well as other general skills that I have learned in the work force
          to create beautiful and responsive web sites all created by a carefully crafted and well maintained codebase.
